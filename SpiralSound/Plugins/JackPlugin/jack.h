   a port is an object used for moving data in or out of the client.

   in various ways.

   a port has a short name, which may be any non-NULL and non-zero
   length string, and is passed as the first argument. a port's full
   name is the name of the client concatenated with a colon (:) and
   then its short name.

   a port has a type, which may be any non-NULL and non-zero length
   string, and is passed as the second argument. for types that are
   not built into the jack API (currently just
   JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE) the client MUST supply a non-zero size
   for the buffer as the fourth argument. for builtin types, the
   fourth argument is ignored.

   a port has a set of flags, enumerated below and passed as the third
   argument in the form of a bitmask created by AND-ing together the
   desired flags. the flags "IsInput" and "IsOutput" are mutually
   exclusive and it is an error to use them both.
